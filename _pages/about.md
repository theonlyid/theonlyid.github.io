### About This Blog

This website is aimed at showcasing the work that I have done (and currently doing) in the fields of translational neuroscience and neurotechnology.
Each post contains basic information regarding the motivations, methods and outcomes (if any) for various projects, including links to publications or code repositories for further perusal.

My primary interest and focus has been in real-time signal processing and forecasting of neuronal activity for neurorehabilitation and neural repair. Most of the projects outlined in this blog are connected by that common theme. I'm interested in developing novel algorithms that learn to identify neural events (such as seizures), or brain-states (such as feeling happy or sad), in real-time. I'm also interested in developing neurotechnologies that enable better signal acqusition, are progressively less invasive, and are safer.

### About Me

I am a systems neuroscientist / data scientist with 10 years' experience in both generating (recording) and analyzing complex, multi-modal datasets (fMRI, EEG, intracortical-electrophysiology) and drawing insights from them.

After spendig my early childhood in Vancouver, CA, my family moved to Delhi, India where I pursued my high school and univeristy degrees. I was trained as a molecular biologist / biotechnologist with a focus on genetic engineering / technology.

For my PhD I decided to pursue my fascination for neuroscience, and joined the prestigious lab of Prof. Nikos Logothetis at the Max Planck Insitute for Biological Cybernetics, where I was investigating neurovascular coupling in non-human primates on the one hand, and developing novel neurotechnologies for neurorehabilitation on the other.

In 2017 and 2018 at the Wyss Center for Neurotechnology in Geneva where I was working on a number of projects ranging from novel medical devices for epilepsy or stroke monitoring to a brain-computer interface for completely locked-in patients using signals from an implanted multi-electrode array. The projects that I did there cannot be shared openly, but I would be happy to discuss non-critical aspects about them in case you'd like to know more about them. 

An overview of these projects are in my [Resume](https://theonlyid.github.io/assets/docs/resume.pdf).
