### About This Blog

This blog is aimed at showcasing the work that I have done (and am currently doing) in the fields of translational neuroscience and neurotechnology.
Each post contains some basic information regarding the motivations, methods and outcomes (if any) for the various projects, including links to publications or code repositories for further perusal.

### About Me

I am a systems neuroscientist / data scientist with 10 years' experience in both generating (recording) and analyzing complex, multi-modal datasets (fMRI, EEG, intracortical-electrophysiology) and drawing insights from them.

After spendig my early childhood in Vancouver, my family moved to Delhi, India where I pursued my high school and univeristy degrees. I was trained as a molecular biologist / biotechnologist with a focus on genetic engineering / technology.

For my PhD I decided to pursue my fascination for neuroscience, and joined the prestigious lab of Prof. Nikos Logothetis at the Max Planck Insitute for Biological Cybernetics, where I was investigating neurovascular coupling in non-human primates. I founded a novel technique in this process that significantly reduces the cost of studying NVC by a factor of 100.

I spent two years at the Wyss Center for Neurotechnology where I was working on a number of projects ranging from novel medical devices for epilepsy or stroke monitoring to a brain-computer interface for completely locked-in patients using signals from an implanted multi-electrode array. The projects that I did there cannot be shared openly, but I would be happy to discuss non-critical aspects about them in case you'd like to know more about them.
