I am a systems neuroscientist / data scientist with 10 years' experience in both generating (recording) and analyzing complex, multi-modal datasets (fMRI, EEG, intracortical-electrophysiology) and drawing insights from them.

After spendig my early childhood in Vancouver, my family moved to Delhi, India where I pursued my high school and univeristy degrees. I was trained as a molecular biologist / biotechnologist with a focus on genetic engineering / technology.

For my PhD I decided to pursue my fascination for neuroscience, and joined the prestigious lab of Prof. Nikos Logothetis at the Max Planck Insitute for Biological Cybernetics, where I was investigating neurovascular coupling in non-human primates. I founded a novel technique in this process that significantly reduces the cost of attacking NVC by a factor of 100.

I was invited to the Wyss Center for Neurotechnology to convert the technique into a novel medical device in 2016.
