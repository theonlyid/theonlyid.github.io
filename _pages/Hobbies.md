In my spare time I like to indulge in some reading, writing and film photography.

I love communicating complex scientific ideas to the general public, and used to write for a popular science magazine while I was pursuing my master's degree.
You can find some of my articles on [Down to Earth](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/author/ali-danish-zaidi-262).

I also enjoy connecting systems neuroscience to sociology. Some of those rants have been published in an online journal in India called ["Youth Ki Awaaz"](https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/author/ali_danish_zaidi/)

Occasionally, I enjoy indulging in 36mm film photography, either black and white, or positive slide film.
