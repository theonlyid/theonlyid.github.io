Thanks for visiting my page. I'm currently rebuilding this website.

For checking out my code, please visit my github page (follow the link in the bio section).
The repository 'seizuredetection' has a jupyter notebook in the docs folder. This notebook showcases my data science, feature engineering and machine learning skills. Be sure to check it out!

For following my research, and getting access to my papers, please click the 'Homepage' button in the bio section. That will take you to my Google Scholar page.

Please be sure to check back in a few days for an update! The site should be up and running by next week.
