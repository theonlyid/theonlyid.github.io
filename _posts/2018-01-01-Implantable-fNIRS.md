## A wireless, minimally-invasive, batteryless, completely implantable fNIRS system


Epidural fNIRS, having shown remarkable promise in capturing correlates of highly localized neural events, and when combined with the results from my studies on neurovascular coupling, is the perfect tool for recording neural activity without compromising the dura. 

Our results from EEG-fNIRS studies demonstrate that it is easier to classify brain-states using fNIRS than EEG (due to the non-stationarity of EEG features). This makes epidural fNIRS a fantastic candidate for long term epilepsy / stroke monitoring as well as neurofeedback applications.

With that in mind, I am currently working on a peri-osteal wireless implant that will record fNIRS activity and enable neurofeedback.
