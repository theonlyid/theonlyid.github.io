I was fortunate enough to join the lab of Prof. Logothetis after a brief stint as a graduate student in Septmeber 2011. 
IT was a dream come true, to be working in one of the most prestigious neuroscience labs on earth. Simultaneous fMRI and intracortical electrophysiology was the stuff of legends, and no other lab on the face of the earth had been able to pull it off with such success! 

As a bewildered geneticist, I remember the first lab presentation I attended. The postdoc spoke of mutual information and the correlation kernels. I was the Alice to a wonderland of amazing stuff.
