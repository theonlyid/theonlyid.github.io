**PhD in Cogntive Science, Department of Computer Science, University of Tuebingen (Magna cum Laude)**

I am a systems neuroscientist / data scientist with over 10 years of experience in both generating and analyzing complex, multi-modal datasets (fMRI, EEG, intracortical-electrophysiology), and drawing insights from them.
I have a deep interest in healthcare and medical technology, and I bring domain knowledge from diverse fields such as genetics, molecular biology, systems neuroscience, and computer science. I have a passion for discovering deep insights and attacking complex problems.

<h4>Where I come from</h4>
<p></p>

After spending my childhood in Vancouver, CA, my family moved to Delhi, India where I attended high school and university. I was trained as a molecular biologist / biotechnologist with a focus on genetic engineering / technology.

For my PhD I decided to pursue my fascination for neuroscience, and joined the prestigious lab of Prof. Nikos Logothetis at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics, Tuebingen, where I was investigating neurovascular coupling in non-human primates on one hand, and developing novel neuro-technologies for neuro-rehabilitation on the other.

In 2017 and 2018 I was at the Wyss Center for Neurotechnology in Geneva where I was working on a number of projects ranging from novel medical devices for epilepsy or stroke monitoring to a brain-computer interface for completely locked-in patients using signals from an implanted multi-electrode array. The projects that I did there cannot be shared openly, but I would be happy to discuss non-critical aspects about them in case you'd like to know more about them. 

My primary interest and focus has been in real-time signal processing and anlaysis of neuronal activity for neurorehabilitation and neural repair. This includes clustering, classification and decoding of real-time multi-modal signals. Most of the projects outlined in this blog are connected by that common theme. I'm interested in developing novel algorithms that learn to identify neural events (such as seizures), or brain-states (such as feeling happy or sad), in real-time. I'm also interested in developing neurotechnologies that enable better signal acquisition, are progressively less invasive, and are safer.

An overview of these projects are in my [resume](https://theonlyid.github.io/assets/docs/resume.pdf).

<h4>About This Blog</h4>
<p></p>

This website originally started as an introduction to the work that I have done (and currently doing) in the fields of translational neuroscience and neurotechnology. However, it has slowly evolved into a more general blog where I share my thoughts on various aspects of analytics, ranging from its philosophy to its practice.
